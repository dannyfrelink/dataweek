## üí° Concept

We were giving the assignment to make a visualisation about our journey between school and home. We chose to use the Mickey's journey for this assignment. His journey consists of a short walk from his house to the tram station, taking the tram to Wibbautstaat and another walk from there to school.

The data we chose to measure is about the speed of Mickey on his journey and the time it took him to complete it. We also chose to take the traffic lights, he'll pass on his way, into consideration. We've measured the maximum waiting time in minutes for each traffic light. We've used Geo data of the map of Amsterdam to show the route of Mickey's journey on.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process

Since Mickey is more Visual based and Danny more Tech based, we chose to divide those tasks between us. Mickey was in charge of creating all the SVG's inside our visualisation. Danny got the tasks to convert these SVG's interactive by converting it to code. The collaboration went smoothly with some contact over WhatsApp.
